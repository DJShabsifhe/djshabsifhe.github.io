There has been thousands of views online debating whether developers will be replaced by the emerging artificial intelligence, specifically the Large Language Models(LLM), in the recent years. However, as an engineer myself, I highly doubt that electronic engineers will be replaced by AI. 

First of all, the source and author background of these views seems to be so scattered that their credibility should be doubted. The access of social media has granted the ability to speak up about diverse ideas to experts, geeks, and hobbyists; but those who brags about their TikTok knowledge may also want to express themselves. This gap of conscience has created meaningless debates. I have seen thousands of comments under a video talking about the threat AI could bring to engineers, yet they seem do not understand what an engineer does. 

Second, electronic engineers are building the foundations of AI. We design chips that accelerate AI models, server centers that host AI services, and software architectures for better AI applications. AI would replace electronic engineers basically means it has the capability to invent itself, and that way it will quickly replace all others by making the AI for their jobs. As we all would reject a future like this (unless we have an equally prosperous society), political and economical driving forces will take effect. If there are still some people that are not replaceable, they are the engineers of AI.

Some would say that human labor is not replaceable. For example, chef, musicians, and electricians, etc. They assume robots (or, embodied intelligence) develops more slowly and produces inferior products, so these jobs can still survive. Thinking that way, they missed an important point; this has happened before. During the two industrial revolutions, machines replaced human labor in textile, farming, transportation, and many other fields. Although human labor in these areas still exists in some parts of the world, we can see that the most developed countries has adopted machinery for mass production. Because of the product’s cheap price, it dominates the consumer market. Back to the topic, I would say that opinion is inverse because it develops from a wrong start point. Human labor is replaceable, and it will be the first to replace. 

Third, coding is replaceable. We are still in a very early stage of agent coding, but now nobody (if so, you have my highest respects) codes without the support of some kind of AI. Yes, I do believe that we will all use AI for coding soon, but that only means coding has come in a different way, not that AI has “replaced” coding. I have came across several projects on GitHub that focus on using Chinese to code in the past years. They have the same core as AI coding: to make it easier to read, write, debug applications, preferably in a way that is in the developer’s native language. We have dreamed about using natural language to code. When that tool emerges, coding has not disappeared. It has morphed, like it does every several years.
